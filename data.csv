The report focused on Elephants in European zoos, and it stated that ""bringing elephants into zoos profoundly impairs their viability."" Georgia J. Mason, who lead the study, also stated that zoos do not need to abandon the idea of keeping elephants in captivity, although he did recommend that imports of the animal should only occur in zoos which have a track record of successfully addressing issues in elephant's health, and have a productive breeding programme.

“Currently zoos are consumers rather than producers of elephants,” added Mason. “We feel that’s not really appropriate.”

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums criticised the findings. The organisation's senior vice president for conservation and education, Paul Boyle, described the research as “terribly flawed.”

Boyle also stated that he did not remember any time when elephants were brought into the US for zoos. ""I cannot speak for other countries,"" he added ""but that [the statement that elephants are imported for zoos] is not true of the United States.”

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O’Mara has already signaled that his client will plead not guilty at a future hearing which the judge set for May 29, but he also expects to request bail for his client once safety details are worked out.",http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimmerman_stands_before_judge_for_the_Trayvon_Martin_shooting

The report focused on Elephants in European zoos, and it stated that ""bringing elephants into zoos profoundly impairs their viability."" Georgia J. Mason, who lead the study, also stated that zoos do not need to abandon the idea of keeping elephants in captivity, although he did recommend that imports of the animal should only occur in zoos which have a track record of successfully addressing issues in elephant's health, and have a productive breeding programme.

“Currently zoos are consumers rather than producers of elephants,” added Mason. “We feel that’s not really appropriate.”

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums criticised the findings. The organisation's senior vice president for conservation and education, Paul Boyle, described the research as “terribly flawed.”

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest.

A power sharing deal was signed approximately three weeks ago, as a way to resolve a crisis that has been ongoing since the elections over three months ago.

Nelson Chamisa, a spokesperson for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) expressed grave concern over failure to reach a deal. He described it as ""a threat to people's lives"". 

""People are dying,"" Chamisa said. ""The humanitarian response has to be activated and you need a functional government to do that.""

Thabo Mbeki, formerly the president of South Africa has said that he will continue to help secure an agreement between the politicians by mediating the discussion. 

In the deal signed three weeks ago it was agreed that Tsvangirai is now the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, acting as the head of the council of ministers. It was also agreed that Mugabe remains the president of Zimbabwe, meaning that he is still the chair of the cabinet. 

The proposed cabinet contains sixteen seats from the MDC, while Mugabe's Zanu-PF has fifteen seats. The MDC also controls the police while Zanu-PF controls the armed forces.

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in.

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in.

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved.

Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O’Mara has already signaled that his client will plead not guilty at a future hearing which the judge set for May 29, but he also expects to request bail for his client once safety details are worked out.",http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimmerman_stands_before_judge_for_the_Trayvon_Martin_shooting

The judge found probable cause in the charges of second degree murder, but Zimmerman's lawyer held off on making a bail request out of concern for his clients safety.

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

At a Wednesday evening news conference in Jacksonville, Florida, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Zimmerman willingly turned himself in. A law enforcement official said at the time Zimmerman was in custody at the Seminole County Jail in Florida. Corey said, ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment.""

Zimmerman, 28, was involved in an altercation with the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin that led to Martin’s death the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed self-defense when he shot Martin. Martin was in a gated community returning to the house he and his father were staying at carrying a pack of candy and iced tea when Zimmerman followed him and called the police to report a ""suspicious"" character. Since then, black leaders have demanded justice for a murder that they believe to be driven by race.

Zimmerman’s arrest and charge occurred after his lawyers announced Tuesday they were quitting the case after having no contact with him since Sunday. They also said Zimmerman was in a fragile mental state. 

In Florida, a person charged with second-degree murder can spend life in prison, and the charge is usually when a confrontation ends with the death one of the parties involved. Florida also has a Stand-your-ground law, which means people can use deadly force in cases of self-defense, which is expected to play a major role in the case. In the United States, 24 states, including Florida, have such a law while the other 27 states do not. The National Rifle Association pushed for the law's passage in Florida seven years ago.

Trayvon Martin’s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, have been publicly calling for Zimmerman to be prosecuted. They appeared at a press conference after the special prosecutor's announcement with Reverend Al Sharpton in Washington, D.C. Fulton said, ""We simply wanted an arrest. We wanted nothing more and nothing less, we just wanted an arrest. And we got it.""

Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O’Mara has already signaled that his client will plead not guilty at a future hearing which the judge set for May 29, but he also expects to request bail for his client once safety details are worked out.",http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimmerman_stands_before_judge_for_the_Trayvon_Martin_shooting
