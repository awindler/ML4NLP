## Introduction
News recommendation is a commonly tackled task in natural language processing. In our era of massive sources of information available, the appropriate pre-selection of candidates matching the specific interest of a user is a crucial task. Both the user and the providing platform profits from such a system, as users whose needs are fulfilled may stay longer in such an environment. Given its purpose, news recommendation may be seen as an instance of classical Recommender System. According to Ricci et al. (2010), such a system is composed out of three basic components:

- User: A user is an entity having an interest in consuming items given its special preferences.
- Item: A product is an entity from a set, which is chosen by the system for best matching the preferences of a user. In our case, these items are news articles.
- Preferences: A preference is a feeling of a user regarding an item, commonly described as likes and dislikes.

Many current websites use such systems for different modalities. Examples are the selling of products (i.e. Amazon), the recommendation of movies and series (i.e. Netflix) or the providing of somewhat pleasant, interesting or funny posting (i.e. Facebook).

[TODO: Collaborative filtering vs Content-based filtering]

In order of implementing such a news recommendation system utilized supervised machine learning, we have to define our goals. In a nutshell, we define our task as approximating an unknown function *f*, which gets the preferences of a user and an article as input and returns a score indicating the predicted interest of the user for that article. Iterating through the set of news articles and evaluating the function multiple times, such an implementation would find the most relevant articles from a corpus.
